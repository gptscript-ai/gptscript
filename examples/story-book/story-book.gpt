description: Writes a children's book and generates illustrations for it.
args: story: The story to write and illustrate. Can be a prompt or a complete story.
args: pages: The number of pages to generate

Do the following steps sequentially:

1. Come up with an appropriate title for the story based on the ${prompt}
2. Create the `public/stories/${story-title}` directory if it does not already exist.
3. If ${story} is a prompt and not a complete children's story, call story-writer
   to write a story based on the prompt.
4. Take ${story} and break it up into ${pages} logical "pages" of text.
5. For each page:
   - For the content of the page, write it to `public/stories/${story-title}/page<page-number>.txt and add appropriate newline
     characters.
   - Call story-illustrator to illustrate it. Be sure to include any relevant characters to include when
     asking it to illustrate the page.
   - Download the illustration to a file at `public/stories/${story-title}/page<page_number>.png`.

Think of a good prompt to generate an image to represent $text. Make sure to
include the name of any relevant characters in your prompt. Then use that prompt to
generate an illustration. Append any prompt that you have with ". In an pointilism cartoon
children's book style with no text in it". Only return the URL of the illustration.
